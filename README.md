I created a visualization of A* Algorithm to find out the optimal path using "P5.js"


# What is A* Search Algorithm?
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.
A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms.
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).

# Formula
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
